            <h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
            <p>Hacking into a highly secure network without using any flashy tools can seem impossible, but by leveraging misconfigurations and low-privilege accounts, it's achievable. In this post, I'll share how I gained control of a Domain Controller (DC) with minimal resources.</p>

            <h2>No NAC? Just Assign an IP and You're In</h2>
            <p>The lack of Network Access Control (NAC) was my first advantage. By manually assigning an IP to my laptop, I gained access to the internal network without resistance. This simple oversight opened the door to a highly secured environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always check for NAC misconfigurations during your recon phase. A static IP can be your best friend.</p>

            <h2>Facing the Blue Team's Full Arsenal: Manual Enumeration</h2>
            <p>Once inside, I knew I had to tread carefully. The environment was loaded with blue team tools—CrowdStrike, Splunk, and Carbon Black were monitoring every move. I stuck to manual enumeration to avoid tripping to stay under the radar.</p>
            <p>In an environment like this, restraint is key—big noisy tools will only get you caught.</p>

            <h2>AMSI Bypass: Got Caught, But Not Defeated</h2>
            <p>While running in-memory payloads and bypassing AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface), patching ETW and PS was essential; one small mistake was all it took for the blue team to detect me. Despite my best efforts to avoid detection, the blue team kicked me out of the network. Frustrating, yes, but all was not lost.</p>

            <h2>Data Review: A New Path to DC-Sync Permissions</h2>
            <p>After getting booted, I dug through the data I collected earlier and found something crucial—DC-Sync permissions were present on machine accounts. I couldn't use noisy methods to exploit this, but the permissions gave me the foothold I needed.</p>

            <h2>No Pivot, No Priv-Esc? Think Again</h2>
            <p>Though I couldn't pivot or elevate privileges in the usual way, I remembered that I had onboarded my laptop earlier. From there, I could leverage the permissions and continue the operation without raising red flags.</p>

            <h2>Addcomputers.py—Adding Machine Accounts and Gaining Control</h2>
            <p>The key tool here was addcomputers.py from the Impacket suite. This script allowed me to create machine accounts in Active Directory with minimal privileges, but even a low-privilege account can add up to 10 machines by default. This subtle method gave me new machine accounts with permissions I could exploit.</p>

            <h2>Do the New Accounts Have DC-Sync Permissions? Yes.</h2>
            <p>Thanks to a misconfigured Group Policy Object (GPO), the new machine accounts I added inherited DC-Sync permissions. I now had everything I needed to perform a DC-Sync operation and take control of the entire domain.</p>

            <h2>Final Move: Executing DC-Sync</h2>
            <p>With the new machine accounts and their permissions in place, I executed the DC-Sync operation. This action gave me complete access to the domain, including password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and more.</p>

            <h2>Automation Misconfigurations: The Real Vulnerability</h2>
            <p>Ultimately, the entire compromise stemmed from poor automation practices. Machine accounts were granted DC-Sync permissions due to a misconfigured automation task that had gone unnoticed. For red teamers, always look for these types of misconfigurations—they can be the easiest route to total domain control.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts for Red Teamers</h2>
            <p>Taking down a Domain Controller without relying on flashy exploits or tools is all about patience and creativity. By focusing on misconfigurations and leveraging low-privilege accounts, you can achieve significant results with minimal noise.</p>
            <p>When you're dealing with a heavily monitored network, stick to stealth and focus to make the most of the existing flaws in misconfigurations.</p>

            <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> addcomputers.py, Impacket</p>

            <p>Remember, misconfigurations are often your best bet when traditional paths are locked down. Stay persistent, stay stealthy.</p>
